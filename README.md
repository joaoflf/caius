# caius
Dashboard Prototype using Angular 2 with ngrx/store. The usage of @ngrx/store is to design the application using the redux architecture/paradigm.
The folder structure is laid out in a feature/component manner, meaning that each feature/component folder has its own views, components, actions, reducers, etc. 
The app also uses firebase with angularfire2.
